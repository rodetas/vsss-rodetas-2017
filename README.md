# Rodetas

> The Rodetas team is composed of students from Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP), especially students graduating in Control and Automation Engineering and Computer Science. We represent the university in nacional and internacional robotic competitions at the category IEEE VSSS (Very Small Size Soccer), in addition we have already been south american champions.

> The game is based on 2 teams against each other, with 3 robots each of them which act with the support of mathematical models and with no direct human interference during the match. The next tutorial explains how to install the software used by the team during the match. Our main dependencies are: [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [GTKMM](https://www.gtkmm.org/en/).

## How to install Rodetas Software

You can install all the Rodetas dependencies using our script. Just run in the project root directory:
